Welcome Nerds, this package consists of a full configuration and initialization
of the Minecraft Server.

As it stands there two versions of the server:

--> Minecraft 1.14.4 - Vanilla
--> Minecraft 1.12.2 - Modded

These versions can be both setup however the server can only run one at a time.
If one instance of the server is running, the other version will not be initialized.
Once a session is finished both can be initialized after.

It is possible to play both versions using an official or non-official Minecraft account.

Feel free to invite any friends and use and abuse each version at your convenience.

If you're more inclined to the Modded Version follow the Instructions in the Modded Folder.

If you're more "vanilla" follow the Instructions in the Vanilla Folder.
